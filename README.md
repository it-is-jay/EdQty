## 🚀 Inspiration
As international students, we've faced language barriers that often hinder understanding core concepts. A single unfamiliar term during a lecture can derail comprehension entirely. For students with learning disabilities like dyslexia or ADHD, the challenges are even more pronounced—long lectures and complex readings can feel insurmountable.  

These shared struggles inspired us to reimagine learning as an interactive and accessible experience for everyone. **EdQty** was born to break down language barriers and cater to diverse learning needs, empowering students to grasp concepts confidently and effectively.

Our vision is simple yet profound: academic progress should never be hindered by linguistic or learning challenges. EdQty fosters inclusivity and support, promoting engagement and success for a diverse student community.
